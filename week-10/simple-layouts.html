        <h2>Simple Layouts</h2>

        <p>One of the easiest layouts you can do in web design is take well-structured content, place it in a container and center the container.</p>

        <p>Studies show people are most comfortable when reading across a page about 60-70 characters across.</p>

        <p>On the web we try not to expand a container beyond 960px since it's still a pretty standard screen size.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>A centered layout</h2>

        <p>You need only two components to create a simple, centered layout:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>A <code>div</code> wrapping your content in your HTML file</li>
          <li>CSS declarations on that <code>div</code> specifying <code>width</code> and <code>margin</code></li>
        </ol>

      <section>
        <h2>Working with <code>max-width</code></h2>

        <p>What if we wanted our centered container's content to adjust as it became smaller? (Maybe someone is viewing the site on a phone or tablet.)</p>

        <p>When we use the <code>max-width</code> property, we're telling the browser to not let our content stretch beyond the value specified.</p>

        <p>This provides us with flexibility to set space for our content in a design, but also make it elastic if the viewport is smaller than the alotted space.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Working with <code>min-width</code></h2>

        <p>Some browsers (Firefox) will crush a block element without mercy.</p>

        <p>What if our design called for flexibility, but not at the total expense of our content?</p>

        <p>Using <code>min-width</code> will limit how much an element can be re-sized.</p>
